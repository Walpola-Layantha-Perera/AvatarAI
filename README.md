Multimodal LLM and ASR with NVIDIA NeMo
Welcome to the Erfurt City AI Avatar System! This repository is designed to showcase the power of NVIDIA NeMo, a conversational AI framework, to create a multimodal chatbot capable of understanding both text and voice inputs and generating responsive, dynamic visual avatars.

Project Overview
The Erfurt City Chatbot project is a comprehensive AI chatbot that integrates Large Language Models (LLM) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) capabilities, leveraging NVIDIA NeMo to:

Train and fine-tune domain-specific language models for accurate, context-driven responses.
Enable high-quality ASR for voice input and real-time conversation.
Generate on-the-go avatar animations to provide a visual, interactive experience.
This bot specializes in providing information about the city of Erfurt, handling inquiries about historical landmarks, cultural sites, and other areas of interest.

Features
Text and Voice Interaction: Interact with the chatbot through text input or speech recognition.
Dynamic Avatar Animations: Visual responses using animated avatars that change based on the chatbot’s response.
Domain-Specific Understanding: Enhanced with custom-trained NeMo models on Erfurt-related datasets for contextually accurate responses.
Tech Stack
NVIDIA NeMo: For LLM fine-tuning and ASR model development.
Transformers: Leveraging Hugging Face models for foundational LLM capabilities.
Streamlit: A fast and easy interface for interacting with the chatbot.
Pygame & gTTS: For playing voice responses and generating spoken outputs.
Setup and Installation

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support (recommended for NeMo)
NVIDIA NeMo: pip install nemo_toolkit['all']
2. Clone the Repository


3. Install Required Packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Setting Up NVIDIA NeMo Models
To enable NeMo for both text and voice handling, set up pre-trained models in the following categories:
ASR Model: Download a NeMo ASR model or fine-tune on your domain-specific dataset if available.
Language Model: Download or fine-tune an existing model using domain-specific data.
Example setup:

python
from nemo.collections.asr.models import ASRModel
from nemo.collections.nlp.models.language_modeling import TransformerLMModel

asr_model = ASRModel.from_pretrained(model_name="stt_en_conformer_ctc_large")
nlp_model = TransformerLMModel.from_pretrained(model_name="nemo_gpt")

5. Dataset Preparation
To customize the chatbot’s responses and ASR accuracy:

Text Dataset: Curate text data relevant to the city of Erfurt for LLM fine-tuning.
Audio Dataset: Collect domain-specific audio samples to train or fine-tune the ASR model.
Use NeMo Curator to preprocess and manage your dataset for training.

6. Run the Chatbot
Start the chatbot by running the main Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py
Usage
Select Input Mode: Choose between “Type your question” or “Use voice command.”
Ask a Question: If voice mode is selected, speak your question; in text mode, type it directly.
View Responses: The chatbot will respond via text and play an audio response. Visual avatar animations may play for specific responses.

Challenges
Dataset Quality
Domain-specific text and audio data are crucial for high accuracy. Building a quality dataset for ASR and LLM training with NeMo can be time-intensive but is essential for optimal chatbot performance.

Infrastructure
Deploying NeMo-based models requires GPU support, especially for real-time ASR and LLM inference. Cloud GPU services like NVIDIA’s NGC are recommended for larger scale deployments.

Customization and Fine-Tuning
Tuning NeMo models for specific domain terminologies and accents can improve accuracy but requires a specialized dataset and training time.
