Historical Background
Erfurt's history is long and storied, beginning as a settlement in the prehistoric era. The city was first mentioned in a document in 742 AD, when Saint Boniface founded the diocese of Erfurt. The city's favorable location at the crossroads of important trade routes contributed to its growth and prosperity. By the 13th century, Erfurt had become a significant member of the Hanseatic League, a powerful commercial and defensive confederation of merchant guilds and market towns in Northwestern and Central Europe.

During the medieval period, Erfurt was known for its thriving agriculture, particularly the cultivation of woad, a plant used to produce blue dye. The city's economic success in the Middle Ages was largely based on this trade. Erfurt was also a center for education and religion. In 1392, the University of Erfurt was founded, making it one of the oldest universities in Germany.

In the centuries that followed, Erfurt experienced a series of political changes. It came under the control of the Electorate of Mainz and later became part of the Kingdom of Prussia.
